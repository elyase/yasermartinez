title: Doctrine 1.2 and Memcached Woes
---

<p>This is one of those blog posts that I feel obligated to write, so that when someone has the same issue as I did, they can find my blog on page 26 of the Google results for &#8220;HTF DOCTRINE MEMCACHED CLEAR AARGSHOIF&#8221; and see why Doctrine won&#8217;t clear their cache entries.</p>

<p>It all started harmlessly, with me installing Memcached in my local dev environment. I used <a href="http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/" target="_blank">Homebrew</a> to install Memcached itself, and then downloaded the PECL extension and installed it <a href="http://www.sohailriaz.com/how-to-install-memcached-with-memcache-php-extension-on-centos-5x/" target="_blank">with these instructions</a>. I had previously configured a class to aid with clearing the Doctrine result cache entries, so it was just a matter of editing it to clear the entries from Memcached instead of APC.</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">&lt;?php
class myCache{

    public static function clearRegexMatches($regex){
       Doctrine_Manager::getInstance()
            -&gt;getAttribute(Doctrine_Core::ATTR_RESULT_CACHE)
            -&gt;deleteByRegex($regex);
    }

    public static function clearOne($name){
        Doctrine_Manager::getInstance()
            -&gt;getAttribute(Doctrine_Core::ATTR_RESULT_CACHE)
            -&gt;delete($name);
    }

}
</pre>

<p>And zing! Memcached was up and running! Symfony and Doctrine were using it perfectly, I couldn&#8217;t believe how easy it was.</p>

<p>And then, of course, problems ensued. I spun up an Elasticache instance on AWS and used &#8220;yum install php-pecl-memcached&#8221; to install the PHP extension on our EC2 servers. Everything looked fine until the next day, when <a href="http://blog.mygovhub.org" target="_blank">Nick</a> called me over with an interesting bug. </p>

<p>Basically, when a user updates their address on GovHub, we run a massive calculation to determine who the government representatives are for their location. Naturally, we cache the results of this operation so that browsing the site doesn&#8217;t make you think that you&#8217;ve been transported back to 1998 and you&#8217;re on a 56k modem.</p>

<p>The problem now was that those cache results weren&#8217;t getting cleared. Simple enough, right? Error in my code somewhere, maybe a new commit broke it, something of the sort? But no, everything was working fine on my local machine. Even more confusingly, sometimes the list of representatives would appear to have updated, only to revert back to its previous state the next time you viewed the page. This was worse than failing silently, this was failing in a way that seemed <em>designed</em> to confuse the hell out of me.</p>

<p>After banging my head against the table for two days, I finally got the good sense in me to run a quick &#8220;php -i&#8221; and compare my local phpinfo to that on EC2. And lo and behold, yum had installed the PHP Memcached extension version 3.0.5 (on the beta branch), and of course when I uninstalled 3.0.5 and installed the stable 2.2.6, the problem was solved.</p>

<p>So, my message to anyone out there reading this, is that <strong>the PHP PECL Memcached extension version 3.X is NOT COMPATIBLE with Doctrine 1.2.</strong> Possible side-effects of this incompatibility may include insomnia, alcohol abuse, and head trauma. After experienced all three in my pursuit of this bug, I&#8217;m pretty sure you&#8217;ll want to avoid using the two together.</p>
