<p>I&#8217;m sorry it didn&#8217;t work out between us. I tried my best to stay with you, through good times and bad, but yesterday I reached my final straw.</p>

<p>You see, I&#8217;m afraid that we were only together because you were my best choice in a sea of less-than-adequate PHP PaaS providers. After one of my cofounders (also our SysAdmin) left, I knew that we were only one small misstep away from downtime or worse. I would have loved to use a more mature service like Heroku, but our site is built with Symfony, and <a href="http://ved-antani.com/2011/09/host-a-wordpress-blog-on-heroku/">Heroku&#8217;s PHP-compatible stack</a> didn&#8217;t seem ready for production use. So I hunkered down, spent a day testing out my different options, and came to the conclusion that you were the right one. You offered everything I needed: cron, deploy hooks, deploying from different branches, environment variables, easy email queueing… but for all that you offered, you could barely seem to get any of it right.</p>

<p>Most of your problems came down to a simple lack of communication. There were oh-so-many times when I navigated to our application, only to realize that it was displaying an error or offline altogether. Your excuse was always the same, <em>&#8220;oh, our monitoring system just caught that, I was about to tell you&#8221;</em>, and <em>&#8220;oh, that must have just happened&#8221;</em>.</p>

<p>Sometimes you would change restrictions on features or remove them without even notifying me, a user who was relying on them. When I told you that my cronjob to send queued emails wasn&#8217;t firing, you said <em>&#8220;oh, we limited the minimum frequency to 15 minute intervals.&#8221;</em> I didn&#8217;t quite understand… surely, you knew that your product wasn&#8217;t still in beta, and that people were actually <em>paying </em>to use it?!</p>

<p>When deploys worked, they were great: ~1 minute to deploy, I could see the logs streaming by… but half of the time, it was an entirely different story. Deploys would stall, sometimes for hours or even overnight.</p>

<p>When I pushed a big commit, our redesigned UI, you started to seemingly serve either the new site or old site at random. Sometimes you would serve the new site, but the old site&#8217;s assets. Our production site was a mess for the next hour, and it was no one&#8217;s fault but your own.</p>

<p>Most recently, I noticed that our site was grinding to a halt on certain pages, and others were taking 5x longer to load than on my development machine at home. We had an impending <a href="http://www.govhub.org/hub/653/q-a-with-berkeley-city-councilman-gordon-wozniak-o">live event</a>, and there was no way we were doing it with a forum that took 50 seconds to load. I spent two frantic, stressful days on chat with you, profiling every facet of my application, trying to understand why on earth it was so slow on your platform. I finally got a call late at night: <em>&#8220;Adam, I think we figured it out. We turned on CPU throttling a few days ago, and it seems that it&#8217;s been a little overzealous.&#8221;</em></p>

<p>I knew at that point that I couldn&#8217;t take it any longer. Sure, you had all of these cool, awesome features, but it wasn&#8217;t worth the abuse I was subjecting myself to.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m back with AWS, and while every minute I spend ssh&#8217;ed into EC2 is one that I could be writing code, at least I know that when my deploy hooks start failing and my application&#8217;s assets aren&#8217;t served, or when my automated database backups don&#8217;t run, it&#8217;ll be my fault and not yours.</p>

<p><small>Edit: Just sent this to my support contact at Pagoda, thought it deserved to be posted here too: &#8220;i hope you understand that i&#8217;m still extremely grateful for the level of service &amp; support you provided for us in the past couple of months. i hope, for you, that you&#8217;re able to solve your issues internally and with softlayer. and when you do, i&#8217;ll try using PB again. very cautiously.&#8221;</small></p>
