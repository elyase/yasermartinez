title: How I'll be spending my next 6 months
---

<p>
I'm excited to announce that as of today, I've officially been sworn in as a <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/innovationfellows">Presidential Innovation Fellow</a>, working on <a href="http://www.twitter.com/ProjectRFPEZ">Project RFP-EZ</a> for the next 6 months. This opportunity came as a total surprise to me, and I'm humbled to be part of the inaugural fellowship class here in Washington, DC.

I'll be blogging more as I get settled, but for now, be sure to follow us at <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/innovationfellows/rfpez">http://www.whitehouse.gov/innovationfellows/rfpez</a> as we seek to revolutionize the federal government's IT procurement process. (Which I guarantee is something that's a whole lot more exciting than it looks on paper.)
