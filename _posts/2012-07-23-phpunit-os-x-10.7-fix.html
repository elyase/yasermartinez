title: Fixing my PHPUnit install on 10.7
---

<p>So a tragedy happened, and after a blissful three months of coding in Ruby, I&#8217;m back to working with PHP.</p>

<p>Today, me and a coworker both ran into an issue where after installing PHPUnit, it would fail silently, just returning a blank prompt after typing <code class="prettyprint inline">phpunit</code> into terminal. After opening up my php_error.log, I found that it was throwing this error:Â  <pre class="prettyprint">PHP Fatal error: require_once(): Failed opening required 'File/Iterator/Autoload.php' (include_path='.:/Applications/MAMP/bin/php/php5.3.6/lib/php') in /usr/local/share/pear/PHPUnit/Autoload.php on line 45</pre></p>

<p>If you&#8217;ve ever used PEAR, you probably know that it&#8217;s an absolute abomination and would probably work better as a torture device than as a functional package manger. Well, it turns out that there are many PHPUnit packages floating around the internet, and I just hadn&#8217;t gotten the correct one.</p>

<p>My process for updating PEAR and installing the most recent (as of 7/22/2012!) PHPUnit is below. Hope this helps!</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
# Updates pear to latest version
sudo curl <a href="http://pear.php.net/go-pear.phar">http://pear.php.net/go-pear.phar</a> &gt; go-pear.php
sudo php -q go-pear.php

# Uninstalls phpunit and reinstalls correct version with all dependencies
sudo pear uninstall phpunit
sudo pear install --alldeps --force channel://pear.phpunit.de/PHPUnit
</pre>
