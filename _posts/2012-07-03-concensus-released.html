<a href="https://github.com/adamjacobbecker/concensus">Concensus: A RubyGem for reading U.S. Census Bureau's TIGER/Line Shapefiles.</a><br/><p>Shipping my little weekend project here. This is my first attempt at writing a RubyGem, so feedback is totally appreciated. I think I was able to provide a decent API wrapper over the mess of files in the Census Bureau&#8217;s <a href="http://www.census.gov/geo/www/tiger/">repository</a>.</p>
